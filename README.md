# QuickCopy
## An easier way to copy and move files with the Window's Command Prompt

Unless you're doing it within a single directory, copying or moving files with the Window's Command Prompt often requires typing out the full paths of the source and destination.

QuickCopy allows you to select a file from your current working directory, change to the directory you'd like to copy/move the file to, and then just paste it there.

Use the help flag for full instructions: quickcopy --help
